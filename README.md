# MpsPowershell

## Overview

PlayFab Multiplayer Powershell module useful for creating and managing PlayFab Multiplayer Server builds. This module is generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest), and is a replacement for the [old Multiplayer Powershell](https://github.com/PlayFab/MultiplayerPowershell) cmdlets.

Most of the contents of the [MpsPowershell](\MpsPowershell) folder are autogenerated by AutoRest, with the exception of the [custom](\MpsPowershell\custom), [resources](\MpsPowershell\resources), [custom](\MpsPowershell\custom) and [examples](\MpsPowershell\examples) folders. 

## How to Use

See [docs](\MpsPowershell\docs) for a list of cmdlets in the module. `Set-PfTitle` must be called before any other cmdlets in order to set up auth. 

See [how-to.md](how-to.md) for more detailed instructions.

## Building
1. Install [Autorest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest)
1. Download or clone [Multiplayer.swagger.json](https://github.com/PlayFab/API_Specs/blob/master/Swagger/PlayFab/Multiplayer.swagger.json) from the PlayFab/Api_Specs repo.
1. Run the following in [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) (building the module only works in PowerShell Core, but the resulting module can then be used in both PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    # Replace "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" with the path you downloaded the file to.
    # Also make sure to increment the module version if you're planning on publishing to PowerShell Gallery.
    .\generate.ps1 -Input-File "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" -Module-Version 0.1.0
    
    .\MpsPowershell\build-module.ps1 -pack

    # If everything succeeded, there will now be a .nupkg file in \MpsPowershell\bin that you can publish to PowerShell Gallery.
    ```
1. **optional** There is a C# project, CustomPsModule, that is used to manually generate some cmdlets that were easier to write in C# than in Powershell. That project is found in  [\MpsPowershell\resources\CustomPsModule](MpsPowershell/resources/CustomPsModule), and its build output is checked into [\MpsPowershell\custom\CustomPsModule](MpsPowershell/custom/CustomPsModule). If you need to make changes to that project, just build it in Visual Studio and copy the build output there.
