## Overview

The PlayFabMultiplayerAPI module is useful for creating and managing PlayFab Multiplayer Server builds. This module is generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest), and is a replacement for the [old Multiplayer Powershell](https://github.com/PlayFab/MultiplayerPowershell) cmdlets.

Most of the contents of the [MpsPowershell](\MpsPowershell) folder are autogenerated by AutoRest, with the exception of the [custom](\MpsPowershell\custom), [resources](\MpsPowershell\resources), and [examples](\MpsPowershell\examples) folders.

## Installation

```powershell
PS> Install-Module -Name PlayFabMultiplayerApi
```

## How to Use

See [docs](\MpsPowershell\docs) for a list of cmdlets in the module. `Set-PfTitle` must be called before any other cmdlets in order to set up auth. 

See [how-to.md](how-to.md) for more detailed instructions.

## Building
1. Install [Autorest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest)
1. Download or clone [Multiplayer.swagger.json](https://github.com/PlayFab/API_Specs/blob/master/Swagger/PlayFab/Multiplayer.swagger.json) from the PlayFab/Api_Specs repo.
1. Run the following in [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) (building the module only works in PowerShell Core, but the resulting module can then be used in both PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    # Replace "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" with the path you downloaded the file to.
    # Also make sure to increment the module version if you're planning on publishing to PowerShell Gallery.
    PS> .\generate.ps1 -Input-File "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" -Module-Version 0.1.0
    
    PS> .\MpsPowershell\build-module.ps1 -pack

    # If everything succeeded, there will now be a .nupkg file in \MpsPowershell\bin that you can publish to PowerShell Gallery.
    ```
