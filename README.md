# MpsPowershell

## Overview

PlayFab Multiplayer Powershell module useful for creating and managing PlayFab Multiplayer Server builds. This module is generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest), and is a replacement for the [old Multiplayer Powershell](https://github.com/PlayFab/MultiplayerPowershell) cmdlets.

## How to Use

See [how-to.md](how-to.md)

## Building

Everything inside of [/output/](output) is generated by Autorest, with the exception of [/output/custom](output/custom). To regenerate the contents of /output/, do the following:
1. Download or clone [Multiplayer.swagger.json](https://github.com/PlayFab/API_Specs/blob/master/Swagger/PlayFab/Multiplayer.swagger.json) from the PlayFab/Api_Specs repo.
1. Run the following in [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) (building the module only works in PowerShell Core, but the resulting module can then be used in both PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    # Replace "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" with the path you downloaded the file to.
    # Also make sure to increment the version if you're planning on publishing to PowerShell Gallery.
    .\build.ps1 -Input-File "path/to/Multiplayer.swagger.json" -Module-Version 0.1.0
    ```
1. If everything succeeded, there will now be a .nupkg file in \output\bin that you can publish to PowerShell Gallery. Or, if you want to import the module locally, you can run this command:
    ```powershell
    .\output\build-module.ps1 -run
    ```
